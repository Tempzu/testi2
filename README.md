Practising gh-pages with code from codecademy angular.js practise that I have slightly modified. The code picks up emails' information from https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/ltp4/emails-api/emails.json page and show's their name and date until clicked, in which case it shows also the message within email.

Code in gh-pages branch.
